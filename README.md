> This project is a landing page about LooBank, the next generation bank. This project is originally from [JavaScript Mastery Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oO4Qi5aVZs "Build and Deploy a Fully Responsive Website with Modern UI/UX in React JS with Tailwind").

I learned and implemented most of the things in the tutorial. In this project, there are popular technologies I learned like:
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/ "Tailwind CSS")
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org "React JS")
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev "Vite")
